The term “distant reading” was popularized by Franco Moretti’s 2013 book of the same name. It proposed to use precise methods to study large corpora of literary texts extending well beyond the canon. Moretti and the Stanford Literary Lab called their method “quantitative formalism.” While Moretti’s 2013 approach underscores the opposition of distant reading and more traditional close reading, scholars have pointed out that this antinomy is superficial as, in actuality, these strategies are mutually enriching (Jänicke et al. 2015; Pilshchikov 2018, 40-2). In his recent book Distant Horizons. Digital Evidence and Literary Change, Ted Underwood conveys a similar vision: “Instead of displacing previous scales of literary description, distant reading has the potential to expand the discipline - rather as biochemistry expanded chemistry toward a larger scale of analysis” (Underwood 2019, xviii). Based upon his mature reflection on the matter, Underwood proposes a “2.0 version” of the method, which he calls critical distant reading (Underwood 2019, xix, original italics). The 2.0 approach focuses on hypothesis testing rather than exploratory data analysis: instead of venturing into the dark forest of data without a plan, Underwood suggests beginning by formulating an “interpretative hypothesis.” Moreover, Underwood underscores that is it crucial to tie a new study to existing research, since otherwise, scholars  may fall into the pitfall of “cherry-picking” the subsets of data that confirm their assumptions (Underwood 2019, 17). Underwood insists on the importance of statistical models which “offer new methods of representing and interpreting the world.” Underwood maintains that such models are especially good for studying borderline cases and tracking down historical trends. Yet, he claims that currently, statistical models contribute only 1% to literary analyses (Underwood 2019, xix, xxi, 17, 145, 146).

However, emerging interest in “quantitative formalism” is not so much twenty-first century innovation as it is a revival. Already at the beginning of the previous century, the members of the Moscow Linguistic Circle (1915-1924) applied precise methods to the study of literature, and among them, a prominent scholar, Boris Iarkho, even authored a comprehensive treatise titled “The Methodology of Precise Literary Studies.”  Therefore, it is not surprising that Russian Quantitative Formalism is recently gaining in popularity. One of the early signs of this interest was the 2015 Stanford conference on “Russian Formalism and the Digital Humanities” (see Bozovic 2015; Ustinov 2016). In 2019, the Journal of Literary Theory published a special issue on “Moscow Formalism and Literary History,” which included works of Boris Iarkho, Mikhail Gasparov, and Maksim Shapir. In their preface, “Data-Driven Formalism,” Frank Fischer, Marina Akimova, and Boris Orekhov wrote:
> Readers of this volume unacquainted with Yarkho and Gasparov will be astonished about how close they are to present-day Digital Humanities practices. They use >  large text corpora and work their way through an abundance of calculations, and they do all that despite the lack of two things that are so essential for > quantitative research today: a computer, and a research team assembling different skills and expertises (Fischer, Akimova, and Orekhov 2019, 1-2).

Importantly, Boris Iarkho not only wrote the aforementioned treatise, but also created two quantitative studies of drama (“Komedii i tragedii Kornelia. Ètiud po teorii zhanra”)” [“The Comedies and Tragedies of Corneille (A Study in the Theory of Genre)”] and “Raspredelenie rechi v piatiaktnoi tragedii (K voprosu o klassitsizme i romantizme” [“Speech Distribution in Five-Act Tragedies”]) which exemplified his methods in practice. As Igor Pilshchikov points out, Iarkho’s approach entails the following components: 1) analysis, i.e., identification of the features that characterize the works in the corpus; 2) synthesis, i.e., statistical operations on the obtained values of these features; 3) analysis, i.e., contextualization of the results obtained in the synthesis through comparison/contrast with other literary works (Pilshchikov 2018, 44). Iarkho’s studies satisfy the 2.0 distant reading requirements in that they propose and test interpretative statistical models for genre and style differentiation and evolution, which address important questions for literary history and typology.

The above-mentioned works by Iarkho focused on quantitative drama research, a field that has seen an increasing number of projects in the past two decades. The overarching research questions, which echo Iarkho’s earlier explorations, include genre differentiation (Digital Literary Network Analysis, Shapir, Schöch) and historical development of drama (Sperantov and Digital Literary Network Analysis). Yet, one can see that recent quantitative drama research has been dominated largely by network analysis, which encouraged us to seek alternative approaches and bring earlier Quantitative Formalist methods into attention and practice.  Thus, I continued Iarkho’s previous work and applied an enhanced version of his methodology to a different genre and on a different corpus, i.e., the Russian and French five-act comedy in verse. My null hypothesis was that my results will be consistent with Iarkho’s previous model of genre evolution, whereas my alternative hypothesis was a rejection of this model, or at least, a questioning of its universality. I used Iarkho’s four features (percentage of non-duologues, the standard range of the speech distribution, mobility coefficient, and the mean number of dramatic characters per play) to ensure that my results were directly comparable with Iarkho’s previous findings, which allowed me to test Iarkho’s earlier model of style evolution on a different genre (five-act comedy in verse) and corpus. However, I did not simply adopt Iarkho’s methodology; instead, I modernized it by utilizing the computer for text digitalization and processing as well as feature extraction and visualization. Furthermore, my research ran more modern statistical tests and relied on a larger corpus, which included new texts that had never been studied before and the texts which had never been studied using Iarkho’s methods. Additionally, I incorporated Sperantov’s research on stage direction, which applied Iarkho’s methodology to the study of the evolution of the Russian tragedy. I utilized three formal features from Sperantov’s work (the frequency of the stage directions, the average length of a stage direction, and the degree of the verse and prose interaction in a play) and compared my results concerning the evolution of the Russian comedy in verse with his findings. Furthermore, for German comedies, which I briefly compared with Shakespeare, I incorporated data from the recent projects, namely the number of dramatic characters in a play (that is, network size) from the “Drama Corpora Project.” To make the project useful for future researchers and to ensure reproducibility of the results, I provided open access to the data and my coded pipelines in Python on Github. Ultimately, I hope that my findings and analysis will be a valuable source of interpretation of historical and cultural change for broader scholarship and readership. 

Such a diachronic study of verse comedy allowed me to examine an additional research question concerning the place of Aleksandr Griboedov’s *Gore ot uma* [Woe from Wit, 1824], Russia’s most famous comedy in verse, in relation to other comedies in the corpus. This play is unique in many regards, among which are that it has four acts, which has no tradition in Russia and it is written in free iambs (first used in 1795), whereas the preceding tradition, from which this recent innovation derives, is a five-act comedy in “long” verses (iambic hexameters). Moreover, a more appropriate genre label for *Gore ot uma* is, as Maksim Shapir has demonstrated, is tragicomedy rather than comedy (Shapir 2000, 267-8). Therefore, our research allowed us to place this important Russian comedy in a broader historical context.
