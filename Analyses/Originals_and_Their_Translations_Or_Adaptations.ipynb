In his translation of Molière's *Le Tartuffe*, Khmel'nitskii decreased the gap between the percentage of monologues and the percentage of polylogues as compared to Molière's original (which could be a sign of the Neoclassical taste), but still kept the gap much larger than in his translation of Molière *L'École des femmes*. In the translation of both comedies, Khmel'nitskii increased the mobility coefficient, which could reflect the taste for higher mobility coefficient in the Russian and French traditions after 1795."

    "## Conclusions:\n",
    "1. Translation and adaptation of a comedy often included not only lexical and/or semantic changes, but also structural modifications of the original.\n",
    "2. Vasilii Karatygin's *Zhenatyi filosof* (1827) was the most similar comedy to its original, Nericault-Destouches's Le *Philosophe marié* (1727) (cosine similarity = 0.9992). The second most similar translation to its original was Nikolai Khmel’nitskii's translation of Molière's *L'École des femme*s  (cosine similarity = 0.9943).\n",
    "3. Two adaptations of the same original (Chéron de la Bruyére *L'Homme À Sentiments ou Le Tartuffe de moeurs* and Pisarev's *Lukavin*) decreased the values of most of the features as compared to Sheridan's *The School For Scandal*. However, *Lukavin*, remained closer to Sheridan (cosine similarity = 0.9634) than *L'Homme À Sentiments* (cosine similarity = 0.9477). The two adaptations appeared to be the most dissimilar out of analyzed examples (cosine similarity = 0.9362).\n",
    "4. The continental traditions were closer to one another than the English comic tradition. The Russian translations of the French original comedies as well as the French adaptations of the French originals experienced less structural transformation, with the smallest cosine similarity = 0.9898). French and Russian translations and adaptations of the English comedy experienced a more substantial transformation (with the smallest cosine similarity = 0.9477).\n",
    "5. Two of Molière's comedies (*Le Tartuffe* and *Le Misanthrope*) had extremely low percentage of monologues  (3.23 and 0 respectively), which the translators and imitators increased."
